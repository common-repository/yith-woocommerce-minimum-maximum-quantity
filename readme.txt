YITH WooCommerce Minimum Maximum Quantity allows you to set a minimum and/or maximum quantity for purchases in your shop

== Description ==

If you are trying to limit the number of items that can be purchased from your WooCommerce shop by one user, YITH WooCommerce Minimum Maximum Quantity is what you are looking for. It is very useful to set a minimum quantity for WooCommerce items that can be added to the cart when their price is really small, either because sometimes shipping costs are much more expensive than single item cost or just because you are a wholesaler and you prefer dealing only with intermediaries instead of final customers. Set a minimum number of items and you can spare the nuisance and the embarrass of having to cancel orders containing less items than you can afford. We all know that even if you show users a huge notice message saying that they cannot purchase less than, say, 5 items, there always be someone that will place an order with 1 or 2 items. The only way to prevent them from doing that is to use some kind of restriction and YITH WooCommerce Minimum Maximum Quantity can help you with that.
The same goes for maximum quantity in WooCommerce cart. Are you wondering why you should limit sales? Think you are making a special offer and you don't want that a few customers make rid of all items in stock with a few orders, what would be best than limiting maximum quantity of products in WooCommerce cart?

Compatibility with all themes is impossible, because they are too many, but generally if themes are developed according to WordPress and WooCommerce guidelines, YITH plugins are compatible with them.
Yet, we can grant compatibility with themes developed by YIThemes, because they are constantly updated and tested with our plugins. Sometimes, especially when new versions are released, it might only require some time for them to be all updated, but you can be sure that they will be tested and will be working in a few days.


= How can I get support if my WooCommerce plugin is not working? =

If you have problems with our plugins or something is not working as it should, first follow this preliminary steps:

* Test the plugin with a WordPress default theme, to be sure that the error is not caused by the theme you are currently using.
* Deactivate all plugins you are using and check if the problem is still occurring.
* Ensure that you plugin version, your theme version and your WordPress and WooCommerce version (if required) are updated and that the problem you are experiencing has not already been solved in a later plugin update.
